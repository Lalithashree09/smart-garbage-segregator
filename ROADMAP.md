# Project Roadmap & Pitch

## 🚀 Elevator Pitch
**"EcoSort AI"** is an intelligent waste management system that leverages computer vision to automate garbage segregation. By combining state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection with a premium, real-time dashboard, we empower facilities to reduce recycling contamination by up to 40%. It's not just a detector; it's a complete analytics platform for the future of smart cities.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Completed)
- [x] YOLOv8 Integration
- [x] Real-time WebSocket Streaming
- [x] Glassmorphism UI Dashboard
- [x] Basic Analytics

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Next Steps)
- [ ] **IoT Integration**: Deploy to Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano with relay control for physical sorting bins.
- [ ] **User Auth**: Multi-user support for facility managers.
- [ ] **History API**: Database persistence for long-term analytics.
- [ ] **Mobile App**: React Native companion app for on-the-go monitoring.

### Phase 3: Enterprise Scale
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment**: Kubernetes cluster for scaling inference.
- [ ] **Federated Learning**: Edge devices improve the model locally and sync updates.
- [ ] **Carbon Footprint Calc**: Estimate CO2 saved based on recycled mass.
